This article explains how to capture a document scan from a printer to your Windows PC or Mac. These instructions will work on Windows 10, as well as macOS 11 (Big Sur). The instructions require that the drivers are installed and your printer is already in working order.



## Capturing a Scan From a Printer on a Windows PC

Your printer model may come with software including not only its drivers but also a suite of programs to use all the device's functionality. If this is the case, then within those programs there's also likely a scanning program.

But if your model didn't come with such software, or you prefer to use in-built OS functions when possible, these instructions are for you. Take the following steps to capture your scan using tools included with a standard Windows installation.

1. Open the Start Menu, and search for the Scan app.

2. Alternately, press Win+x to call the Power User Menu.

3. Select Settings.

4. Select Devices from the main Settings screen.

5. Next, click Printers & Scanners.

6. Click on your desired printer, then click Manage.

7. If the printer is a multi-function device, it will include a drop-down menu. Select the entry starting with Scanner.

8. Click Open scanner, which will also open the Scan Windows app.

9. Arrange your document's page(s) either on the flatbed or in the feeder, making sure they're aligned correctly.

10. Click the Scan button in the app.





## Capturing a Scan From a Printer on a Mac

**Scanning from a Mac is just as easy as on Windows 10 (arguably, even easier).**

1. Open the Apple menu, and select System Preferences.

2. Click Printers & Scanners.

3. Select your printer, then click Scan.

4. Click Open Scanner.

5. In the Scanner program, you can select the folder to which your scans will be saved by making a select in the Scan to drop-down menu


6. To the right, the Size drop-down menu (shown as US Letter in the above screenshot) will also let you choose the size of the item.

7. If your scanner has a document feeder and you want to use it, select Use Document Feeder.

8. Clicking on Show Details will display a number of additional options, as follows: Scan Mode (Flatbed or Document Feeder), Kind (Text, Black & White, or Color), Resolution (quality of the image in DPI), Rotation Angle (to change the rotation of the saved image), Auto Selection (which can try to detect multiple items on the flatbed and save them separately, for example), Name, Format, and Image Correction

9. Click Scan to start your scanning job.
